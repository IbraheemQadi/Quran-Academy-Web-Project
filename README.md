This project came to help solve a real-world problem. Our system consists of: Admin *Center (number) *Supervisors of each center *Students of the center

(Only the admin is allowed to modify and control everything in the system)

Each supervisor has a group of students who sets grades for them and their listening topic, and no other supervisor can access or modify information that is not for his students.

Each student , supervisor , admin has his own registration number and password.

Supervisor numbers from 1 to 2999. 1 is for addiction For students from 3000 and above

The admin can create centers and add supervisors to each center
